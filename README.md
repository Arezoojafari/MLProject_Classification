# Cancer Classification Model: Machine Learning A-Z

## Overview
This repository contains the project for the "Machine Learning A-Z: Hands on Python & R  in Data Science 2021" course on Udemy. The primary focus of this project is to apply various classification models to a dataset of cancer dataset. 
The goal is to accurately classify and predict the type or stage of cancer using machine learning techniques.



## Models Used
In this project, several machine learning models were implemented to classify cancer types/stages. These include:
- Logistic Regression: Chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification problems.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): Used for its ability to handle non-linear data.
- Random Forest Classifier: Selected for its performance in handling large datasets with higher dimensionality.
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree Classification

## Libraries and Tools
The project utilizes various libraries and tools, including:
- Python: The primary programming language used.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing traditional machine learning models.
